🐷🎮 Pig Game – JavaScript Dice Fun! 🎲
Welcome to the Pig Game – a fun, interactive two-player dice game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! 🎉 This project is part of my learning journey to master JavaScript fundamentals, especially working with the DOM, event listeners, and game logic. It's a simple yet addictive game where players compete to reach 100 points first. 🚀

In the Pig Game, players take turns to roll a dice. Each dice roll adds to the current score, but if a player rolls a 1, their turn ends and they lose the points accumulated in that round. 😬 Players can also choose to 'Hold' their score, which adds the round total to their global score and passes the turn. The first player to reach 100 points wins the game! 🏆

This project uses vanilla JavaScript for all the logic, along with HTML for structure and CSS for styling. 🎨 The game is fully functional and responsive, so it works well on both desktop and mobile screens. 📱

Some key features of the game include:

🎲 Dice roll with random number generation

🔄 Switching between players dynamically

🚫 Losing score on rolling a 1

🧮 Holding score to build up the total

🏁 Detecting the winner and resetting the game

If you're learning JavaScript or looking for a fun browser game to play and improve, this is a great place to start. I've also added a clean UI, a modern layout, and used best practices in JavaScript to keep the code readable and beginner-friendly. ✅

You can play the live demo here (add your deployment link), or feel free to fork the repo and try it out locally. If you like the project, don’t forget to ⭐ star it, 🍴 fork it, or contribute your own ideas and improvements!
